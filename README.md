# Udacity-Tableau
	
In	this	exercise	we	studied	how	different	characteristics	of	baseball	players	(handedness,	height,	weight)	affect	their	performance,	both	in	terms	of	their	batting	average	and	number	of	home	runs	throughout	a	bunch	of	visualizations

# Conclusion:	
The	main	conclusions	are	that	batting	average	and	home	run	have	a	relationship,	high	number	of	home	runs	are	related	with	high	number	of	batting	average	but	not	the	other	way	around,	also	that	left	handed	and	ambidextrous	players	seem	to	have	a	higher	batting	average	that	right	handed.	I	created	a	new	variable	Body	mass	index	(BMI).	Players´BMI	has	a	normal	distribution.	We	can	see	in	the	graph	of	batting	average	and	HR	by	BMI	that	there	is	no	relation	between	performance	and	BMI	-	peaks	in	the	curve	correspond	to	values	with	very	few	data	points.	

# Some Feedback from the first story
I	noticed	that	left	handed	players	and	ambidextrous	have	higher	averages	than	right	handed	players.	
For	me	that´s	the	main	takeaway	from	this	visualization.	I	can	see	the	positive	relation	between	averages	and	the	number	of	home	runs.	
I	don´t	understand	what	the	size	of	the	balls	represents	in	the	first	visualization.	
For	the	first	page,	I	think	there	is	too	much	information	put	together.	Maybe	the	first	page	could	be	used	to	explain	each	domain	of	the	database	(players	characteristics	and	performance)	and	the	following	one	could	show	both	domains	combined.
